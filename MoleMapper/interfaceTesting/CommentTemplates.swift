// Class and Code Blocks
//===================================

    /**
        Start all documentation blocks with slash-double-asterisk and end with usual asterisk-slash.
        Leave blank lines to indicate paragraphs.
 
        This, for instance is a *new* paragraph with the previous _new_ in bold while
        the last one should appear italicized. Other standard markdown items:
 
        # Unordered lists
        - Cheddar: most popular
        - Brie: previously trendiest (but now rather passe)
        - Gorgonzola: Blue by any other name
 
        # Ordered lists
        1. Bold items use *double* asterisks
        2. Italicized items use *single* asterisks
        3. Code items use `backticks`
 
        ## Header levels
        
        You can use hash characters to create header levels.
